# OILER 

Maths and arts for a long time have been contrasting opposites, with **maths being the logical end and arts being the creative one**. 

As the theme for Codejam was “combining opposites” so to abide by that, we’ve decided to combine these opposites via our App, "Oiler" (oil paintings of art and Euler of mathematics) which detects and tells you about the math involved in some of the famous paintings.                                                                                             
With the help of AR foundation provided by Google, we have tried to achieve a better visualisation of the mathematical equations by rendering them in augmented reality as 3D models. 

Enjoy a visual representation of how maths and arts have a strong hidden interrelation.

## Getting Started;

### Prerequisites

* A mobile phone with Android 7 or above.

* Check if your device supports AR foundation [via this link](https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices)

### Installing and User Instructions
1. Simply install the APK “Finalapp2.apk” present in this directory
codejam-21/mysterious-momos/FinalProduct(OpenThis)/

1.	Explore the UI and while scanning the image make sure the screen is at maximum brightness (if scanning a soft copy) and the image is in a well lit up environment if scanning a hard copy. (i.e. a real painting)
1.	Don’t keep the camera too close to the painting and try to main a distance of roughly  30 to 35 cms between the camera and the painting.
   1.	Keep adjusting the distance until AR content is rendered on the image.

(Refer to the video present at in the directory codejam-21/mysterious-momos/_Oiler.mp4/ to get an overview of the usage.)


## Features

1. Currently supports three paintings; 
   
   * Monalisa

   * Leda Atomica

   * The Music Lesson

</p>

1. Renders 3D models of the mathematical relations in AR on the painting and adjusts its rotation, position and scale in accordance with the painting. 

1. Also, contains a "more info" tab for you to read about the theoretical aspects of the painting and the mathematics involved in it.

<img src="https://github.com/distroinfinity/codejam-21/blob/main/mysterious-momos/unity.png" width="275" height="125" />
</p>

* Unity 2019.4.10f1 - development engine

* AR Foundation 2.1.10 – AR package

* AR Core XR Plugin 2.1.12 – Android Specific Framework

### Things which can be worked upon in the future;
1. Adding more paintings to the database.
2. Improving the quality of the 3D model.
3. Imrpoving the UI.
