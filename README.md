## Welcome to OSDCodeJam '21!

### Rules:
- Each participant will be teamed up with 2 or 3 other people by us based on their skills and experience level.
- Your solution should be platform agnostic. For example, if you use filepaths in your submission, use pathlib to create platform agnostic Path objects instead of hardcoding the paths.
- You must document precisely how to install and run your project. This should be as easy as possible, which means you should consider using dependency managers.
- All code must be written and committed within the time constrictions of the jam. Late commits may be reverted, so make sure you leave enough time to bug test your program.
- You must get contributions from every member of your team, if you have an issue with someone on your team please contact a member of the administration team. These contributions do not necessarily have to be code, for example it's absolutely fine for someone to contribute management, documentation, graphics or audio. Team members that do not contribute will be removed from the Code Jam, and will not receive their share of any prizes the team may win.
- You must use GitHub as source control.
- All code and assets must be compatible with an Open-Source license. This is because we will be merging your submission into this repo at the end of the jam.
