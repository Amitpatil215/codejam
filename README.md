# Welcome to OSDCodeJam '21!

## Rules
- Each participant will be teamed up with 2 or 3 other people by us based on their skills and experience level.
- Your project should be platform agnostic. For example, if you use filepaths in your submission, use pathlib to create platform agnostic Path objects instead of hardcoding the paths.
- You must document precisely how to install and run your project. This should be as easy as possible (consider using dependency managers).
- All code must be written and committed within the time constrictions of the jam. Late commits may be reverted, so make sure you leave enough time to bug test your program.
- You must get contributions from every member of your team, if you have an issue with someone on your team please contact a member of the administration team. These contributions do not necessarily have to be code, for example it's absolutely fine for someone to contribute management, documentation, graphics or audio. Team members that do not contribute will be removed from the Code Jam, and will not receive their share of any prizes the team may win.
- You must use GitHub as source control.
- All code and assets must be compatible with an Open-Source license. This is because we will be merging your submission into this repo at the end of the jam.

## Judging
Because programming is full of subtleties and judging is not an exact science, this section will inevitably fall short of being an exact guide for how to win, but it should at least give you an idea of what you should be mindful of as a participant.
- **Code Style:** How easy to read, pleasant to work with, well commented, and self-documenting your code is.
- **README:** How well your README file explains your project, its setup instructions and its features.
- **Uniqueness and Creativity:** In order to level the playing field a bit, we've decided that this is the most important factor. If your idea is an exceptionally good one and you are a beginner, we will cut you some slack on style and execution. It is therefore crucial that you consider _what_ to do more carefully than exactly _how_ to do it.
- **Adherence to Theme:** How uniquely you interpreted the theme and justified it with your idea.
- **Execution:** An important factor is whether your solution is the best solution to the problem you are solving. If your solution is overly convoluted, this will count against you in our evaluation. While the code jam is ongoing, organizers will be available to you for any help or suggestions.
- **Teamwork:** During the code jam, you will be assigned teammates. It is crucial that you find a way to work with your teammates, as we will be evaluating your ability to work as a team. Team members who constantly bicker, complain about each other, or fail to divide up tasks so that everyone can contribute will be penalized when we evaluate the code jam. This does not, however, mean that a team that has a "bad egg" will automatically be unable to win the code-jam. If a team member refuses to play well with the rest of the team or does not participate in the jam, we will usually remove that person from the team and attempt to find a new teammate for the team to replace them.
