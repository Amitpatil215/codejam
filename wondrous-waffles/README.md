# Food Riddle Game

### Description

In this project we created a simple website with the usual HTML, CSS, Javascript for the front end and Python and Flask for the back end.

The user is required to input their name to start the game, once in, you get asked 5 riddles.
In each riddle you have to match opposite food items (food items which should not be eaten together).
The maximum score per riddle is 3 points.
You get 3 guesses per riddle. As you use up your guesses, 1 point is subtracted from that score so if you get one wrong guess you will get 2 points, two wrong guesses is 1 point and three wrong guesses is gameover.
Once the user makes it to the end of the 5th riddle, their score will be added into the highscore file and if they make the top 10, they will be added to the highscore page.
