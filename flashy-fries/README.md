# Study Date 
* Have you ever heard "You can't pay attention to your studies if you are *dating* someone." in your brown household?
    > Uss ladki (/ladke) ne teri padhai mein naiyya paar nahi karvani.

* Have you ever missed (read: *bunked*) your tuitions or coaching to go on a date with someone?
* Do you struggle balancing studies with dating?

With **Study Date™**, we help you get the best of **both** worlds! Study Date™ is Flashy-Fries' attempt at **combining** studying and online dating; both of which are widely considered to have an **opposite** dynamic to each other.

This is how Study Date™ works:
* Visit the Study Date™ website and create an account on it for free. You are given the option to register either as a **student** or as a **teacher**.
* Choose the topic you want to study with or teach a random online date.
* You can either choose to study with a student (Study Date™) or a teacher.
* Our backend matches you with someone who wants to study the same topic and initiates a video call for you with them.
* After you are done studying on video call, you can obtain your reward (cute cat photos) for completing the Study Date™.

We have used the widely hated and ridiculed Comic Sans MS font for *designing* our logo, because why not, since we are *combining opposites*. :smiley:
