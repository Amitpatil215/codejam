# Study Date 
***
* Have you ever heard "You can't pay attention to your studies if you are *dating* someone." in your brown household?

> Uss ladki (/ladke) ne teri padhai mein naiyya paar nahi karvani.

* Have you ever had to miss (read: *bunk*) your tuitions or coaching to go on a date with someone?
* Do you struggle balancing studies with dating?

With **Study Dateâ„¢**, we help you get the best of **both** worlds! Study Date is Flashy-Fries' attempt at **combining** studying and online dating, which are widely considered to be **opposite**  to each other.
